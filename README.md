# c-Myc Oncogene Research

## Overview

The c-Myc oncogene is a crucial transcription factor involved in cancer. It functions by forming a heterodimer with other factors, such as Max. Crystallographic studies have revealed that this structure consists of two heterodimers forming a bivalent heterotetramer. Using Alphafold3, for a set of human genome sequences, we confirmed that the c-Myc-Max complex indeed forms a heterotetramer structure by looping DNA. Our findings reveal that DNA sequence length constitutes a key feature responsible for bivalent heterotetramer formation.
